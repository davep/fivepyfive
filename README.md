# FivePyFive

## Introduction

An annoying puzzle for the terminal, built with
[Textual](https://www.textualize.io/).

## History

5x5 is one of my little go-to problems to help test new development
environments and tools, especially those that are very visual. See
http://5x5.surge.sh/ as an example of the game. Versions I've written
include:

- https://github.com/davep/5x5.xml
- https://github.com/davep/Chrome-5x5
- https://github.com/davep/5x5-Palm
- https://github.com/davep/5x5.el
- https://github.com/davep/5x5-react

amongst others (they're just the ones that I still have code for and which
are on GitHub).

## Objective

The object of the game is to fill all of the squares. When you click on a
square, it, and the squares above, below and to the sides will be toggled.

It is possible to solve the puzzle in as few as 14 moves.

Good luck!
