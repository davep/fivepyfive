# FivePyFive

## Introduction

FivePyFive is designed as an annoying, but fun, puzzle for the terminal,
built with [Textual](https://www.textualize.io/).

## History

5x5 is one of my little go-to problems to help test new development
environments and tools, especially those that are very visual. See
<http://5x5.surge.sh/> as an example of the game. Versions I've written
include:

- <https://github.com/davep/5x5.xml>
- <https://github.com/davep/Chrome-5x5>
- <https://github.com/davep/5x5-Palm>
- <https://github.com/davep/5x5.el>
- <https://github.com/davep/5x5-react>

amongst others (they're just the ones that I still have code for and which
are [on GitHub](https://github.com/davep)).

## Objective

The object of the game is to fill all of the squares. When you click on a
square, it, and the squares above, below and to the sides will be toggled.

It is possible to solve the puzzle in as few as 14 moves.

Good luck!
